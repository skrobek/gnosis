# TEST APP

### QUCIK DESCRIPTION
* Project skeleton base on `create-react-app`
* Start data are generated based on `faker.js` library (random 10 rows)
* Contact form has been based on `redux-form` library with some basic validation
* There were no requirements for tests so they are skipped (mainly because of time limit) - I can describe in a call how to create them
* Sorting has been done as an internal state component
* There is a lot of things to extend for more complex projects - looking forward to talk about code :-)

## HOW TO RUN
Type `npm start` in console
